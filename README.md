# Weather App

A new Flutter project. To practice best Flutter and dart practices.

## Getting Started

### Notes for this app

Create an account at [Open Weather](https://home.openweathermap.org/) to get an `api key` (note that it will take a couple of hours for the endpoint to be available).

Create a `secrets.dart` file in your `lib` folder, and save your api key as `openWeatherAPIKey`
